Accessibility Interview Question: Daily Dosage

These days people are hearing lot buzz around accessibility job openings specially in India.
But most of us are facing challenges like what should we focus on, how should we prepare for the interview for such roles.
As most of us get confused after seeing the Job Description since it demands lot of skills and relevant experience in the field of accessibility.
This subject cannot be mastered overnight, it requires patience, research and to logical reasoning.
Based on my experience I would like to share my views how to answer quite a few accessibility interviews questions.
One of my favourite questions or had been asked frequently is
What motivated you to choose accessibility as you carrier goal? 
The ideology behind this question is to judge the candidate on the parameters:
•	Understanding of the subject
•	How innovative your thoughts are?
•	 Will you be able to work independently if required?

 
The most appropriate way to answer this question would be:
•	Share your own opinion not what you have heard from others. 
•	Correlate the real-life scenarios.
•	Try to state at least one difference among other career roles and accessibility.
•	Illustrate how the organisation can be benefited from your work.
